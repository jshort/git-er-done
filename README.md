# git-er-done
This git repository is to serve as a template for holding a git training session.
The commits will be mostly non-sensical and there will be many branches and no-op
commits simply to create additional history to demonstrate how git deals with
merges and rebases.  Some commits on branches with common origin will be made
simply to force a conflict.  Force pushing will be used frequently to get the
repository back to a known state.
